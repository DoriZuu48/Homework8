				<span class="float">T</span>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About
				twelwe
				o'clock
				a troop of ten or twelwe thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackeing its
				speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes
				marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of
				interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their
				course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
			</p>
			<p>
				The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most
				reason of all to be in a hurry,remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please
				the buffaloes to get out of the way.
				Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers
				upon them.
			</p>
			<p>
				"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they
				were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
				programme! And here's an engineer who does't dare to run the locomotive into this herb of beasts!"
